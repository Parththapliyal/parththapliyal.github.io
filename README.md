### üíº **Projects**

#### **1. Car Price Prediction using Lasso Regression**  
- **Objective:** Developed a predictive model to estimate car prices based on features like year, fuel type, and transmission type.  
- **Details:** Lasso regression was used to handle overfitting by penalizing less important features, ensuring a robust model. Categorical variables such as fuel type and transmission were encoded to improve performance.  
- **Key Results:** Achieved **R¬≤ scores of 0.84 on training data** and **0.87 on test data**, demonstrating strong predictive power.  
- **Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib  
- **Impact:** Provided actionable insights into factors influencing car prices, which can aid in pricing strategy for sellers or dealerships.

#### **2. Sonar Rock vs Mine Classification**  
- **Objective:** Built a classification model to distinguish between sonar signals representing rocks and mines.  
- **Details:** The project utilized a logistic regression algorithm to predict labels based on sonar signal frequencies. The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values and normalize features for better accuracy.  
- **Key Results:** Achieved an accuracy of **83.4% on training data** and **76.2% on test data**, showcasing strong generalization performance.  
- **Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Impact:** This model can be applied in mining industries to automate signal classification, improving efficiency and reducing manual errors.

#### **3. Gold Price Prediction using Random Forest Regression**  
- **Objective:** Predicted future gold prices using historical market data and machine learning techniques.  
- **Details:** Features such as date, stock indices, and currency exchange rates were used to train a Random Forest Regression model. Data was cleaned, normalized, and split for robust evaluation.  
- **Key Results:** Achieved a high **R¬≤ score of 0.989 on test data**, indicating the model's reliability in forecasting trends.  
- **Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Impact:** Enabled better decision-making for investors by forecasting future trends in gold prices with high accuracy.  


#### **4. Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression**  
- **Objective:** Created a linear regression model to predict car prices based on key attributes such as year, fuel type, and ownership history.  
- **Details:** The model was trained on historical data, with categorical variables like fuel type and seller type encoded for better accuracy. Scatter plots and residual analysis were used to evaluate model fit.  
- **Key Results:** Achieved **R¬≤ scores of 0.88 (training)** and **0.83 (test)**, showcasing robust performance.  
- **Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib  
- **Impact:** Helped identify factors influencing car pricing, offering insights for buyers and sellers in the automotive market.
