#### **1. Movie Recommendation System**
- **Objective**: Built a recommendation system to suggest similar movies based on user-selected titles using content-based filtering techniques.
- **Details**: Processed datasets containing movie details like genres, keywords, cast, and crew. Generated tags combining multiple features and used the Bag of Words model for vectorization. Cosine similarity 
  was employed to measure movie similarity.
- **Key Results**: The system provides highly relevant recommendations. For instance, selecting Spectre suggests movies like Skyfall and Quantum of Solace.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, NLTK, Scikit-learn, Pickle
- **Impact**: Improved the movie discovery experience for users by recommending personalized and relevant options based on movie content.

#### **2. Sonar Rock vs Mine Classification**  
- **Objective:** Built a classification model to distinguish between sonar signals representing rocks and mines.  
- **Details:** The project utilized a logistic regression algorithm to predict labels based on sonar signal frequencies. The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values and normalize features for better accuracy.  
- **Key Results:** Achieved an accuracy of **83.4% on training data** and **76.2% on test data**, showcasing strong generalization performance.  
- **Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Impact:** This model can be applied in mining industries to automate signal classification, improving efficiency and reducing manual errors.

#### **4.Car Price Prediction using Lasso Regression**  
- **Objective:** Developed a predictive model to estimate car prices based on features like year, fuel type, and transmission type.  
- **Details:** Lasso regression was used to handle overfitting by penalizing less important features, ensuring a robust model. Categorical variables such as fuel type and transmission were encoded to improve performance.  
- **Key Results:** Achieved **R¬≤ scores of 0.84 on training data** and **0.87 on test data**, demonstrating strong predictive power.  
- **Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib  
- **Impact:** Provided actionable insights into factors influencing car prices, which can aid in pricing strategy for sellers or dealerships.
